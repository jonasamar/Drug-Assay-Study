This file is here to explain the order in which one should run the multiple Rmd files (when values are equals it means it doesn't matter which one is first):

1 - Onset of Labor preprocessing
2 - Onset of Labor curves classification
3 - Onset of Labor feature index

4 - Drug assay preprocessing
5 - Drug assay data visualization
6 - Drug assay models

7 - Drug assay scores and visualization
